# Usage
This application is designed to take user's input, write user info into the database and then, after signing in, user can take this info and display it. Also you should create postgreSQL database "ObiektoweProject" and 3 tables using commands in SQLcommands.txt file in CSVfiles folder. You should also change your PostgreSQL user’s password to ‘2004’ (or change this property in code). Additionally, don’t forget to update the path to the CSV files to ensure that file writing works correctly. Have fun using this app (or reading this code lol).
